This asset is provided as is, for purely non-commercial, educational purposes. If this can help anyone make kickass(-er) art I couldn't be happier.
Please note that this is predominantly an example of PBR material work, thus such things as functionality, topology and mesh optimization might be 

somewhat overlooked.

Now go make something pretty! :D->-<
